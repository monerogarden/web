title: 3.7 Honest opinion
---
In the [Asch conformity experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments) they put a person in a room together with other seven fake participants. Just like a ring signature, one true mixed up with many decoys Then they show them all a picture with three vertical lines of very obvious different lengths, and ask: *¿What line is equal to the first line, A, B or C?*

Even though there’s a clear correct answer, if the fake participants answer out loud first, and say A for example, the real participant answering last, will give the same wrong answer a third of the time. If you run the experiment 12 times, 75% of them conform to the peer pressure at least once.

It proved that we care a lot not to go against the current. We love validation from the group. We don't want to stand out. It may even prove that some people *actually believed* they were seeing lines wrong.

Think about it and the way that people would behave on a perfectly transparent spending paradigm. We'd go downhill very fast. We should [aim for the right answer](3.08_wisdom_of_the_crowd.md), not the most popular one.
