[Yes it is.](2.03_good_money.md)

Don’t get lost in philosophic or etymological discussions. If it walks and talks like a duck, it’s probably a duck. If you earned it with your work, and you saved it for a while, and you spend it to buy something else, then it works like money. And something that works like money is... you guessed it: **money**.

Use your scarce time on this planet to breathe, not argue if we should call the air… air.
