title: 2.3 Good money
---
We’ve been inventing and creating different versions of money for a long time, so we already have a grocery list of good ideas on how it should look like if we want it to perform the three stages of charging, holding charge, and discharging well. Money should be:

- Scarce
- Decentralized
- Fungible
- Durable
- Divisible
- Transportable

You can go deep on the why of any of them, but on this path, we’ll get our hands dirty and see [how it works from scratch](2.04_money_rules.md).
