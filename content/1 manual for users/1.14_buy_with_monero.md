title: 1.14 Buy stuff
---
[Using Monero](1.13_use_monero.md) to pay for things (where it’s accepted) is really pleasant. You can pay to anyone, anywhere in the world, in a minute. If it’s something you can purchase without disclosing your identity, the more sense it makes to use something like Monero to do so.

One good example is [ProxyStore](https://proxysto.re/). It has a physical store in Leipzig, Germany but also ships goods and sells digital goods and you can pay wzith your moneros.

[IVPN](https://www.ivpn.net/) and [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/) both very good VPNs, they don’t even ask for an email address to create an account.z

[Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/) is a private email service. Totally encrypted and without ads.

[Njalla](https://njal.la/) is a privacy service that allows you to purchase a domain, or host a server.

If you live in the US or Canada, [Coincards](https://coincards.com/) lets you buy giftcards to spend almost anywhere.

[Cyphermarket](https://www.cyphermarket.com/) sells apparel and stickers from open source projects.

[Reflectacles](https://www.reflectacles.com/) sells eyewear that blocks infrared light, [read about it](https://www.reflectacles.com/irlenses), it’s cool.

[Anon Shop](https://anonshop.app/) lets you order stuff from Amazon and receive it anonymously on a locker.

[Monero Market](https://moneromarket.io/) is a kind of Monero-based eBay, where users sell things themselves.

But these are only examples, there are people that do a great job gathering those into their own directory, like [Monerica](https://monerica.com/).

But remember, while it’s great to pay with Monero without any extra hoops, you can pay anything that takes almost any other cryptocurrency [using an instant exchange.](1.08_exchange_monero.md) And if you're trying the minimalist lifestyle and don't want no new things, give it a try and [tip someone](1.15_tip_monero.md) with Monero.
